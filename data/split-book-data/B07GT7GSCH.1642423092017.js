window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Outcast and exiled, the demon Tarrik Nal-Valim has long been forgotten by the world of humans. At least, so he thinks. But when he is summoned as a last resort by a desperate sorcerer, it seems as though his past has caught up with him.&nbsp;</p> <p>The sorcerer is Serenity “Ren” Branwen, the daughter of Tarrik’s former master - and friend. Though she seems cold, driven, and ruthless, Tarrik can tell Ren has her back against a wall, and he is compelled by ferocious powers to obey her.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>As their world sinks into a terrifying maelstrom of murder, intrigue, and insurrection, Tarrik is forced to serve Ren’s arcane designs - plans that, if they were to succeed, would resurrect unimaginable power and could destroy Tarrik’s entire race.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But as events unfurl, the lines between demon and master become blurred, and Tarrik realizes Ren is not what she seems. To prevent utter devastation, Tarrik may have to surrender what he values most: a chance at redemption and an end to his exile.</p>";
