When the world comes to a sudden and horrifying end, none would have expected them to be among the few survivors.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hyper-aggressive undead zombie creatures hunt anything living on the surface, where even the grass and trees can kill you. Hiding underground is safe, but not much of a life. Their only escape is a virtual world of magic and monsters where Shari can use her healing skills, and Mace can focus on something other than his fears.&nbsp;</p> <p>But Shari is a light elf, and Mace is a drow. Their people are ancient enemies, and neither would be welcome in the other's world. Still they strive to come together in the game, while they scavenge for food and fight to stay alive in the real world.&nbsp;</p> <p>The odds are against them, and their food will eventually run out. Is their best hope for survival to find a way to upload themselves to the game permanently?</p>";
