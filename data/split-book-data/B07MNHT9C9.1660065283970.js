window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“If you are looking for magic you will find it inside this book. </b><b><i>Sorcery of Thorns</i></b><b> is a bewitching gem, full of slow burning romance, loyal friendships, and extraordinary world building. I absolutely loved every moment of this story.” (Stephanie Garber, number-one</b><b><i> New York Times </i></b><b>best-selling author of the Caraval series) </b></p> <p><b>From the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>An Enchantment of Ravens</i></b><b> comes an imaginative fantasy about an apprentice at a magical library who must battle a powerful sorcerer to save her kingdom. </b></p> <p>All sorcerers are evil. Elisabeth has known that as long as she has known anything. Raised as a foundling in one of Austermeer’s Great Libraries, Elisabeth has grown up among the tools of sorcery - magical grimoires that whisper on shelves and rattle beneath iron chains. If provoked, they transform into grotesque monsters of ink and leather. She hopes to become a warden, charged with protecting the kingdom from their power.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then an act of sabotage releases the library’s most dangerous grimoire. Elisabeth’s desperate intervention implicates her in the crime, and she is torn from her home to face justice in the capital. With no one to turn to but her sworn enemy, the sorcerer Nathaniel Thorn, and his mysterious demonic servant, she finds herself entangled in a centuries-old conspiracy. Not only could the Great Libraries go up in flames, but so could the world along with them.</p> <p>As her alliance with Nathaniel grows stronger, Elisabeth starts to question everything she’s been taught - about sorcerers, about the libraries she loves, even about herself. For Elisabeth has a power she has never guessed and a future she could never have imagined.</p>";
