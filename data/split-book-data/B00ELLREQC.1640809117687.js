window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A new audio edition of the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling sword and sorcery classic, <i>The Legacy</i> is Drizzt at his scimitar-wielding best! </p> <p>Having found a measure of peace among the dwarves in the reclaimed Mithral Hall, Drizzt begins to know contentment for perhaps the first time in his tumultuous life. But for a dark elf renegade from a city ruled by priestesses of a demon goddess, no peace can long last. It is Lolth herself, the dreaded Queen of the Demonweb Pits, who musters her followers to pour up from the black depths of the Underdark to reclaim for their goddess the one soul that had managed to elude her. The soul of Drizzt Do'Urden.</p>";
