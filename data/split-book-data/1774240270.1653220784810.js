Now, his daughter, Agnes, comes to bring him back to the capital with promises of hidden secrets finally revealed.</p> <p>But the city decays, poisonous disorder is rife, and whispered prophecy foretells of cataclysm and doom. Summoned by their no-longer human queen, Auric and Agnes are commanded to carry out an impossible task, one that can be accomplished only with the mysterious blade, Szaa’da’shaela, gifted to Auric on a lunatic's whim.</p> <p>Can Auric and his daughter survive a journey fraught with blood, menace, and madness? And can they pay the price demanded by a being every bit as evil as the Aching God?</p>";
