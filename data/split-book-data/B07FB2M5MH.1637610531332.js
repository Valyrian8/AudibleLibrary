window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Super powers. Super harem. Super awesome.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Contains adult content. Seriously.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Who in his right mind tells both his lawyer and the judge presiding over his murder trial “F--k you!” while still in the courtroom? No one, right? Yeah, you'd be wrong about that. I did.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>You'd say the same thing if you were just found guilty of a murder you didn't commit, though. Call me crazy for going off like that in court, but trust me, you don't know crazy until you see what happened next.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>I never believed in superheroes. I certainly didn't believe I'd become one, or that strategically forming a harem of hot <i>chicas </i>and getting down with them to unlock my superpowers would be the key to my survival.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Did I say my survival? I meant the universe's. No, really.... That's exactly what happened when I was taken to a galaxy of supers, thrown into a prison ship full of villains, and told it was up to me to stop them all. Read on, friend, because it gets a whole hell of a lot crazier from here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Warning: This audiobook contains gratuitous violence and sex, harems, a hot foxlike chick, breasts galore, heads exploding, and ample blood. You might cringe, you will laugh, and hell, you might even cry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Soundbooth Theater presents: more super harem naughtiness! Jamie Hawke's steamy, action-packed adventure is now on audio with the full SBT cast treatment! Justin Thomas James leads yet another sexy bunch of superheroines voiced by the lovely Laurie Catherine Winkel and Annie Ellicott, while our vocal chameleon, Jeff Hays, plays the wise sage and the ultimate villain.&nbsp;</p> <p>Adjust your pants for another titillating aural joyride, and keep an eye out for more audiobooks from Jamie Hawke and Soundbooth Theater!&nbsp;</p> <p>The Soundbooth Theater team for this production:&nbsp;</p> <p>Justin Thomas James - Narration</p> <p>Chad Annie Ellicott - Twitch, Gale, The Blue Lady&nbsp;</p> <p>Laurie Catherine Winkel - Charm, Metallica&nbsp;</p> <p>Jeff Hays - Xin, Ranger&nbsp;</p> <p>Ivy Sherrard - Proofing, editing&nbsp;</p> <p>Justin Thomas James - Production, editing, more</p>";
