window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It's against the law for elves and humans to fall in love. But laws can be broken.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>When Venick is caught wandering the elflands, he knows the penalty is death. Desperate, he lies about his identity in hopes the elves will spare his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Ellina doesn't trust the human, and not merely because he speaks the language of men. Men lie. In elvish, however, lying is impossible. In a moment of intuition, Ellina decides to give Venick a chance: learn elvish, reveal his truths, and she will set him free.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>That is not, of course, what happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>As Ellina and Venick come to know each other, their feelings start to shift. Then Venick uncovers a dark secret, and suddenly, the fate of the elflands seems to rest in his hands. But every choice comes with consequences, and Venick must decide if it's worth risking his life to protect a race that hates him, all to save an elf he's not allowed to love.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Magic, love, and fate collide in this fantasy adventure from S. G. Prince.</p>";
