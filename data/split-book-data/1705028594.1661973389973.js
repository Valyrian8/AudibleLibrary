window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Michael Moorcock began chronicling the adventures of the albino sorcerer Elric, last king of decadent Melnibon√©, and his sentient vampiric sword, Stormbringer, he set out to create a new kind of fantasy adventure, one that broke with tradition and reflected a more up-to-date sophistication of theme and style. The result was a bold and unique hero - weak in body, subtle in mind, dependent on drugs for the vitality to sustain himself - with great crimes behind him and a greater destiny ahead: a rock-and-roll antihero who would channel all the violent excesses of the '60s into one enduring archetype.</p> <p>Now, presented in the author's preferred story order, the classic Elric saga.</p>";
