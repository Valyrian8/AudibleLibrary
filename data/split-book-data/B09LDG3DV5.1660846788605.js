window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Discover the first medieval adventure in the action-packed Chivalry series! Perfect for fans of Bernard Cornwell, Simon Scarrow and Conn Iggulden.</b></p> <p><b>September, 1356. Poitiers. </b></p> <p><b><i>The greatest knights of the age were ready to give battle.</i></b></p> <p>On the English side, Edward, the Black Prince, who'd earned his spurs at Crecy.</p> <p>On the French side, the king and his son, the dauphin. With 12,000 knights.&nbsp;</p> <p>And then there is William Gold. A cook's boy - the lowest of the low - who had once been branded as a thief. William dreams of being a knight, but in this savage new world of intrigue, betrayal and greed, first he must learn to survive.&nbsp;</p> <p>As rapacious English mercenaries plunder a country already ravaged by plague, and the peasantry take violent revenge against the French knights who have failed to protect them, is chivalry any more than a boyish fantasy?&nbsp;</p>";
