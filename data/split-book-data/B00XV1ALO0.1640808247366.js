What signs these shall be, I say unto you: first the earth will flow with the blood of Aen Seidhe, the Blood of Elves....</i> </p> <p>For over a century, humans, dwarves, gnomes, and elves have lived together in relative peace. But times have changed, the uneasy peace is over, and now the races are fighting once again. The only good elf, it seems, is a dead elf. </p> <p>Geralt of Rivia, the cunning assassin known as The Witcher, has been waiting for the birth of a prophesied child.
