window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It is the late 14th century, a dangerous time beset by war and plague. Nicholas Barber, a young and wayward cleric, stumbles across a group of travelling players and compounds his sins by joining them. Yet the town where they perform reveals another drama: a young woman is to be hanged for the murder of a 12-year-old boy. What better way to increase their takings than to make a new play, to enact the murder of Thomas Wells? </p> <p>But as the actors rehearse, they discover that the truth about the boy's death has yet to be revealed.</p>";
