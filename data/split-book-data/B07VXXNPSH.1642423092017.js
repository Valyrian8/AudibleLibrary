window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A waif, her abductor and a twist you won't see coming.</p> <p>For five years, Charlotte (Charlie) Holloway has lived as a boy in the slums. But when one theft too many gets her arrested, her only means of escape lies with a dead man. Charlie hasn't raised a spirit since she first discovered she could do so five years ago. That time, her father banished her. This time, she brings even more trouble upon herself.</p> <p>People are now hunting Charlie all over London, but only one man succeeds in capturing her.</p> <p>Lincoln Fitzroy is the mysterious head of a secret organization on the trail of a madman who needs a necromancer to control his newly \"made\" creatures. There was only one known necromancer in the world - Charlotte - but now there appears to be two. Lincoln captures the willful Charlie in the hopes the boy will lead him to Charlotte. But what happens when he discovers the boy is in fact the young woman he's been searching for all along? And will she agree to work for the man who held her against her will, and for an organization she doesn't trust?</p> <p>Because Lincoln and his ministry might be just as dangerous as the madman they're hunting.</p> <p><b>Author's Note: </b>If you like some or all of the following then you'll enjoy <i>The Last Necromancer</i>: plot twists, waifs, assassins, secret societies, supernatural or paranormal fantasies with romantic elements, feisty heroines, cold-hearted heroes who melt, a slow-burn romance, ghost stories, a dash of humor, mysteries, history, quirky secondary characters, strong female characters, dissident noblemen, and Victorian London.</p>";
