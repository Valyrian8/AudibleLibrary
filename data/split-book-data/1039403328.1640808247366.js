window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“At long last, even gods will know regret....” </b></p> <p>Agnes Manteo now bears her father’s sentient Djao sword, along with a terrible revelation - the gods are charlatans, ancient sorcerers who draw their strength from the suffering of humanity. She and her Syraeic companions have but one duty: to track down those pretenders and end their reign of cruelty and lies, no matter the cost. To that end, the magical blade - mighty, single-minded <i>Szaa’da’shaela </i>- won’t allow any wavering of their commitment.</p> <p>But the empire is in turmoil with the sudden passing of its undying queen. Noble houses clash and threaten civil war, murderous barbarians mass on the frontier in preparation for a bloody invasion, and all feel the aching void left by the clergy, whose temples were devastated by a great fire. Can the kingdom survive, should Agnes succeed in tearing away its very foundations? And if she fails, what might sorcerers with nearly godlike powers do to exact their revenge?&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Idols Fall </i>is the thrilling conclusion to the compelling&nbsp;Iconoclasts&nbsp;trilogy.</p>";
