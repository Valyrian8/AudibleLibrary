window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Michael Thorpe had been considering asking his best friend Riley Sullivan to be his girlfriend, at least until he met another girl who instantly stole his heart.</b></p> <p>The problem is, the object of his sudden infatuation isn’t exactly normal. She has horns, wings, and a tail...and to complicate matters, she might have a fatal interest in Michael derived from her need for human blood.</p> <p>Will his newfound love interest lead to his untimely death?</p> <p>Or can he find a way to make it work out between him and his demon girlfriend?</p> <p>Prologue</p> <p>The scientist was already going down the line, the yellow meter making a soft static crackling as he went. The noise was quiet and consistent while he waved it in front of each student. However, when the man passed in front of the girl next to me, it made a noise that was slightly different for the first time.</p> <p>The scientist waved it in front of her again, only to realize the change in sound only happened when he neared one side of her - the side closest to me. The guy then proceeded to wave it in front of my chest, showing that the slight change in static would disappear the moment he held it far enough to my other side.</p> <p>I wasn’t sure how to react, having no idea the significance of the test, but now all eyes were on me.</p> <p><b><i>Demon Seer</i></b><b> is a full-length novel.</b></p>";
