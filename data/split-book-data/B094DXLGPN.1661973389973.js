All while securing peace and trade agreements with the two largest countries on the continent.&nbsp;</p> <p>Herald Frost wasn’t merely a deviant herald that laid with demihumans. He was a highly capable deviant herald that laid with demihumans. Which was one of the reasons why demihumans were coming from all over to join his territory.&nbsp;</p> <p>His reputation even crossed the ocean and when Cassia, the Prophet of Shalia, heard about Frost, she hopped on the first ship back home to meet the herald.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Herald of Shalia</i> is a fun fantasy Light LitRPG/Gamelit by Tamryn Tamer, and contains attention starved elves, Arachne Queens, demonic princesses, foxy madams, foul language, and completely over the top love-making.
