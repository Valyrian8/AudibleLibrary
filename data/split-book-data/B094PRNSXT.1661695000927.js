Her new home is tucked away at the edge of a cemetery, surrounded on all sides by gravestones: Some recent, some hundreds of years old, all suffering from neglect.</p> <p>And in the darkness, she can hear the unquiet dead whispering.</p> <p>The cemetery is alive with faint, spectral shapes, led by a woman who died before her time...and Keira, the only person who can see her, has become her new target. Determined to help put the ghost to rest, Keira digs into the spirit's past life with the help of unlikely new friends, and discovers a history of deception, ill-fated love, and murder.</p> <p>But the past is not as simple as it seems, and Keira's time is running out. Tangled in a dangerous web, she has to find a way to free the spirit...even if it means offering her own life in return.</p>";
