window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Can the Crystal Shard be destroyed at last? Drizzt is determined to destroy the evil Crystal Shard, and seeks out the help of the scholar-priest Cadderly. But instead, his worst fears are realized, and Crenshinibon falls into the hands of the dark elf mercenary Jarlaxle and his unlikely ally Artemis Entreri. </p> <p><i>The Silent Blade</i> is the book that brought Drizzt back to the Realms, and was a <i>New York Times</i> best seller on its initial release - and has been in print every day since. Like the rest of the Legend of Drizzt(R) reissues, <i>The Silent Blade</i> features beautiful new cover art by award-winning illustrator Todd Lockwood. </p>";
